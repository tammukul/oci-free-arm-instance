# OCI Always Free Arm (A1.Flex) VM Creator

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically tries to provision an "Always Free" `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` (Arm) compute instance in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account.

This is necessary because the "Always Free" Arm instances are a popular resource and are often unavailable due to high demand, resulting in an `"Out of host capacity."` error.

## Features

* **Fully Automated:** Runs entirely within GitHub Actions. You don't need to run anything on your local machine.
* **Persistent:** The workflow runs on a 10-minute schedule, continuously retrying until it successfully provisions your VM.
* **Secure:** All sensitive credentials, keys, and IDs are stored in encrypted GitHub Secrets. The repository itself contains no private information and is safe to be public.
* **Fast:** Uses GitHub's caching to store the `oci-cli` installation, so subsequent runs are much faster.
* **Informative:** Sends detailed notifications to a Discord channel on every attempt, showing the full success or error log (e.g., "Out of host capacity").

## How to Use

To use this, you need to **Fork** this repository and set up your OCI credentials as GitHub Secrets.

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) "Always Free" account.
* A GitHub account.
* A Discord server/channel to receive notifications.

## Step 1: Fork This Repository

Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account. All the following steps will be done on **your fork**.

## Step 2: Generate Your OCI API Credentials

This is the most detailed step. You need to gather **11 pieces of information** from your OCI account and your computer.

### A. Core IDs (Tenancy, User, Region)

1.  Log in to your OCI Console.
2.  **Tenancy OCID:** Click your **Profile icon** (top right) -> **Tenancy: [your\_tenancy\_name]**.
    * Copy the **OCID** value. This is your `OCI_CLI_TENANCY`.
    * *Note: For "Always Free" accounts, this is also your `COMPARTMENT_ID`.*
3.  **User OCID:** Click your **Profile icon** -> **User Settings**.
    * Copy the **OCID** value. This is your `OCI_CLI_USER`.
4.  **Region Identifier:** Look in the top-right corner of the console (e.g., "Singapore").
    * Hover over it or click it to find the identifier (e.g., `ap-singapore-1`). This is your `OCI_CLI_REGION`.

### B. OCI API Key (Private Key & Fingerprint)

1.  On the same **User Settings** page, click **"API Keys"** from the left-hand menu.
2.  Click the **"Add API Key"** button.
3.  Select **"Generate API Key Pair"**.
4.  Click **"Download Private Key"** and save the `oci_api_key.pem` file. **Do not lose this file.**
5.  Click the **"Add"** button.
6.  A "Configuration File Preview" will pop up. From this box, copy the `fingerprint` value. This is your `OCI_CLI_FINGERPRINT`.

### C. VM-Specific IDs (Subnet, Image, AD)

1.  **Subnet ID:**
    * Go to the OCI Console menu (☰) -> **Networking** -> **Virtual Cloud Networks**.
    * Click on your VCN (there is likely one default VCN).
    * Click on **"Subnets"** in the left menu.
    * Click on your public subnet (e.g., `Public Subnet ...`).
    * Copy the **OCID** of the subnet. This is your `SUBNET_ID`.
2.  **Availability Domain (AD) Name:**
    * Go to the OCI Console menu (☰) -> **Compute** -> **Instances**.
    * Click **"Create Instance"**.
    * In the **"Placement"** section, look at the **"Availability Domain"** dropdown. You likely only have one.
    * Copy its name *exactly* as it appears (e.g., `KClJ:AP-SINGAPORE-1-AD-1`). This is your `AD_NAME`.
3.  **Image ID:**
    * On the same "Create Instance" page, in the **"Image and shape"** section, click **"Change Image"**.
    * Select **"Canonical Ubuntu"** (or another OS of your choice).
    * Click the name of the image (e.g., "Canonical Ubuntu 22.04"). A details panel will slide out.
    * Copy the **OCID** of the image. This is your `IMAGE_ID`.
    * You can now cancel the "Create Instance" wizard.

### D. Your SSH Public Key

This is the key you will use to log in to your new server.

1.  Open a terminal on your computer.
2.  Check if you have a key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
3.  **If it shows a key:** Copy the entire output (it starts with `ssh-rsa...`). This is your `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`.
4.  **If it shows "No such file":** Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048`. Press Enter three times to accept the defaults. Then, run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` again and copy the key.

## Step 3: Create a Discord Webhook

1.  Open your Discord server. Right-click on a channel name and click **"Edit Channel"**.
2.  Go to the **"Integrations"** tab.
3.  Click **"Webhooks"** -> **"New Webhook"**.
4.  Give it a name (e.g., "OCI Notifier") and click **"Copy Webhook URL"**.

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

1.  Click the **"Settings"** tab.
2.  In the left menu, click **"Secrets and variables"** -> **"Actions"**.
3.  Click the **"New repository secret"** button for *each* of the 11 secrets listed below.

#### **VM Secrets**

* `OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID` (Value: Your Tenancy OCID from Step 2A)
* `IMAGE_ID` (Value: Your Image OCID from Step 2C)
* `OCI_SUBNET_ID` (Value: Your Subnet OCID from Step 2C)
* `AD_NAME` (Value: Your Availability Domain name from Step 2C)
* `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` (Value: The `ssh-rsa...` key from Step 2D)

#### **Authentication Secrets**

* `OCI_CLI_REGION` (Value: Your region from Step 2A, e.g., `ap-singapore-1`)
* `OCI_CLI_USER` (Value: Your User OCID from Step 2A)
* `OCI_CLI_TENANCY` (Value: Your Tenancy OCID from Step 2A)
* `OCI_CLI_FINGERPRINT` (Value: The fingerprint from Step 2B)
* `OCI_CLI_KEY_CONTENT` (Value: Open the `oci_api_key.pem` file you downloaded in Step 2B with a text editor. Copy the *entire contents*, from `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` to `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`, and paste it here.)

#### **Notification Secret**

* `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (Value: The URL you copied from Discord in Step 3)

## Step 5: Run the Workflow

You're all set! Now you just need to start the process.

1.  Go to the **"Actions"** tab of your forked repository.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **"Try to Create OCI VM"**.
3.  You will see a message: "This workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event." Click the **"Run workflow"** button on the right, and then **"Run workflow"** again.

This will start the first run. From now on, the `schedule` will automatically run it every 10 minutes. You can check the "Actions" tab to see the logs from each run. You will also get a notification in Discord every time it tries.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: What to Do on Success

One day, you will get a **green "success"** notification in Discord. This means your VM has been created!

As soon as you see this, you **MUST** disable the workflow.

1.  Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your repository.
2.  Click on **"Try to Create OCI VM"** in the sidebar.
3.  Click the **three-dot (...)** menu on the right.
4.  Click **"Disable workflow"**.

If you do not do this, the action will continue running every 10 minutes and will try to create *another* VM, which will just fill your logs with errors.

Your VM will be provisioning in the OCI console. You can now log in using the SSH key you provided.
